# Week 12

- in today's class: more work with APIs and NodeJs + generative practices

# Advanced APIs

### Basic example - loading JSON


# API

* API = application programming interface
* an interface for different pieces of software to communicate together over networks
* created by orgs, programmers, companies to access their data
* there are open APIs and those requiring authorization
* start out by using APIs that have tutorials or sample code and consider trying out ones that don't require an API

# Working with an API - the basics

## An example - OpenWeatherMap

* using the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) API
* Sign up and make a new account
* Get your private API key

**IMPORTANT**

Do not post your API key online anywhere publicly! This includes on GitHub.

When working with APIs, they often have a specific way of constructing a URL to access specific data.

Example

```
website.org/?city=London
```

Multiple query values

```
website.org/?city=London&?date=today
```

These are name-value pairs.

## How to access OpenWeatherMap

Construct the URL properly

```
api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&APPID=001b0f58045147663b1ea518d34d88b4
```

* Note: replace the APPID with your own ID

You can put this URL in your browser to see this data.

* You may want to use the JSON Formatter Chrome extension to format this data and make it easier to read.
* Or use Code Beautify [JSON Viewer](https://codebeautify.org/jsonviewer)
