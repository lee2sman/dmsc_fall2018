# Week 11
**No class due to Election Day**

Hi everyone,
I hope you've been enjoying the little break.

## Part 1
- please make sure you've reviewed our class notes on [JSON](https://github.com/lee2sman/dmsc_fall2018/tree/master/week9).
- We'll be reviewing Node and NPM again in class and using them, so make sure you have Node [installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your computer.
- Check out this very [simple](https://shiffman.github.io/A2Z-F17/week3-apis-data/00_corpora/) example of generating text (in this case a Emoji). View source then click and view Daniel's sketch.js [file](view-source:https://shiffman.github.io/A2Z-F17/week3-apis-data/00_corpora/sketch.js) to understand how it works in p5js. It loads [this](https://shiffman.github.io/A2Z-F17/week3-apis-data/00_corpora/sea_emoji.json) JSON file. Consider how an advanced version of this (pulling random words using multiple JSON files) would let you generate more complex sentences, paragraphs, maybe even a whole book...! Notice how the sketch uses a callback so that the next part of the page doesn't load until the full json file is loaded into memory.
- Please review this [list of open APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis). Pick one to work with. *Auth* indicates whether and what you'll need to do to register and access the data. HTTPS indicates the security protocol. CORS indicates whether it will allow you to access the data from a different domain origin without wrapping it. Simplest is best for beginners!
- What APIs are you interested in working with? What kind of data do you want? How would you take this data and use it as an interesting source for making a data visualization or sketch? **Write this down in your notebook or in a text file and bring to class**

## Part 2
- Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WumyfLEa6bU) on Practical Procedural Generation for Everyone by Kate Compton, 30 minutes, for an introduction to procedural generation
- Read some articles from Seeds magazine about procedural generation of art, music, etc. Issues 1 and 2 are [here](http://www.procjam.com/seeds).
- **Do a [Discovery and Research Post](https://github.com/lee2sman/dmsc_fall2018/blob/master/assignments.md) on procedural generation and post it to Moodle. Pick an example from one of the articles or Kate's talk that you are interested in. What is being generated? How does it work? Do you find the artwork/output compelling? Are the pieces different enough, or do they also resemble each other too much? Do you have suggestions for how you would expand this example, or a new procedural generation project you would do based on this one?**
