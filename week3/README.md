# Homework

* Read [The Nature of Code, Introduction](https://natureofcode.com/book/introduction/), 30 - 40 minutes
* You may want to watch The Nature of Code Introduction [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vX8wT1G798&index=1&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aFlwukCmDf0-1-uSR7mklK), 1 hr 20 minutes total, but they are in Processing. They still might help with main concepts. Definitely watch the first introduction video.
* The book's example code has been [ported to p5js](https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code-Examples-p5.js) and can be [downloaded](https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code-Examples-p5.js/archive/master.zip). You will have to run the code locally.
