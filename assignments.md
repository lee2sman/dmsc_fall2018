# Assignments and Projects

# Weekly Assignments

This class involves weekly homework assignments in the form of coding exercises, some technical and theoretical readings, and discovery and research posts. Each week the full required homework items will be listed at the end of that week's tutorial page. They are due at the start of class the next week.

## Discovery and Research Posts

You are to write a series of Discovery and Research posts throughout the term on materials that relate to the project work in this class. These tasks require you to write 250 words on the topic with links to the artists, projects, books or technologies that you mention. These are research tasks and require you to read blogs, books, magazines, looks at websites, go to galleries, explore what tools artists you see are using, etc.

These tasks are designed to broaden your understanding of ideas, issues and approaches of artists and designers working in these areas. See the list of blogs and websites on the research section of the syllabus for starting points.

# Assignment 1
*aka the Tamagotchi project*

For this project you are going to create a person, creature, being or an anthropomorphic object. This creature should have at least 5 distinct [states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_machine) such as resting, eating, talking, crying, sleeping. You should also create a background environment for the creature to live in.

* Listen to [More or Less Human](https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/more-or-less-human/)  - The section on Furby begins starting at around 22 minutes in if you don't want to listen to the entire episode.

This Wikipedia article on [Digital Pets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_pet) also contains info about how humans can get attached to the digital organism. Think about what you've learned. How can you simulate or design states that will compel us to care for or want to interact with your being/creature?

Lastly, your creature should live online and be playable in a web browser. For bonus points, design it to work on a smart phone. Think about sizing, screensize, and the limited options for interacting on the phone.
