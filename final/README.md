# Final Project

So far in class we have covered data visualization, recreating nature and organisms with coded behaviors, devising emergent systems, created flocking particle systems. We've explored the work of media artists working in the realm of a-life, explored experimental toolbuilding, and studied the nature of computation.

Based on this experience use the knowledge acquired from class to create a final project. You can create:

 - an app, a visualization, a website, or an artwork - that uses data, APIs, corpora or other input
 - a work based on our study of simulating ecosystems
 - an artwork or world that uses procedural generation to create new artworks and/or music

 This work is intended to be the capstone project for this course, and ideally one you can share in your portfolio. It should match your own interests, and stretch you.

 # Deliverables

 - Working code living online
 - README/documentation including title, concept and description, any challenges that needed to be worked out, screenshots
