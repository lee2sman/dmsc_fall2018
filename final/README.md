# Final Project

Use the knowledge acquired from class to create a project.

Your project should either be:
 - an app, a visualization, a website, or an artwork - that uses data, APIs, corpora or other input
 - based on our study of simulating ecosystems
 - uses procedural generation to create new artworks and/or music

 This work is intended to be the capstone project for this course, and ideally one you can share in your portfolio. It should match your own interests, and stretch you.

 # Deliverables

 - Working code living online
 - README/documentation including title, concept and description, any challenges that needed to be worked out, screenshots
