# Homework

## Research And Discover Report

- Explore some web projects that use data in creative and interesting ways. Choose one to research in detail and write about your discoveries. Things to consider:
    - Where does the data come from?
    - What technologies are used to retrieve the data?
    - Is the data updated in real time?
    - What technologies are used to present the data?
    - What is the creator trying to make the data tell us?

## Warmup projects

## Sketch using data/input from the web

- Create a sketch that either uses data from an external source or uses a database in some way. Come up with a novel way of presenting the data that your sketch is retrieving.

## NaNoGenMo 2018

National Novel Generation Month - based on an idea Darius tweeted on a whim, where people are challenged to write code that writes a novel.

Create a proposed idea for [National Novel Generating Month 2018](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2018).

[Open an issue](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2018/issues/new) and declare your intent to participate. If you already have some inkling of the kind of project you'll be doing, please title your issue accordingly. Also feel free to comment on other participants' issues. Start exploring ways of getting output! Start coding!
